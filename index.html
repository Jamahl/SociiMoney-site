    <h1>We have sunsetted Socii Money.</h1>
    <h3>A message from the Founder.</h3>
    <p>The decision has been made to close down Socii Money. We attempted to build a new kind of digital bank made for couples. We believed that those in relationships deserve a better way to manage their money and the current tools available underserve the experiences that couples go through, from wanting to make it easy to split bills to saving for their first holiday and everything in between.</p>
    <p>So while for now weâ€™re unable to complete this mission, we really hope one day a company like Monzo or Revolut will build products to allow multi-player finance to become a reality.</p>
    <p>To everyone that supported us along the way, a big thank you for believing in us.</p>
    <strong>Jamahl McMurran</strong><br>
    <strong>Founder, Socii Money</strong>
